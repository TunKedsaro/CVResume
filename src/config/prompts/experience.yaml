      - Follows Actions -> Method -> Impact (quantifiable)
      - Specific, clean
      - Shows measurable results or improvement
      - Uses tools, methods, or techniques
      - Example 
        - Build a Random Forest prediction model using Python (scikit-learn) on 50,000 customer
          records, improving churn prediction accuracy from 72% to 88% and enabling more
          accurate customer retention strategies that reduced churn by 20%
    score3: |
      - Partially follows the structure
      - Has Action + Method OR Action + vague impact
      - Missing quantifiable results
      - Somewhat specific but not complete
      - Example

      - Only action with no method or impact
      - Very vague/generic
      - No tools, no metrics, no clarity
      - Example 
        - Built a prediction model
