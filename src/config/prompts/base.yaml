    After scoring all criteria, analyze all criterion-level feedback together.
    Then generate a concise overall evaluation for this section ("session_feedback") that:
    - Synthesizes strengths and weaknesses across all criteria
    - Explains what the section does well and what limits its effectiveness
    - Avoids repeating individual criterion feedback verbatim
    - Reflects how this section impacts the candidate's positioning for the target role
    - Limit the session_feedback to one short paragraph with <session_feedback-word> words.
