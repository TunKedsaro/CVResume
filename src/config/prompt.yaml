criteria:
  Completeness:
    score5: |
      Section contains all key elements from expected_content for this section with enoughdetail to understand the candidate's background and context. No major information gaps.    
    score3: |
      Section contains all key elements from expected_content for this section with enoughdetail to understand the candidate's background and context. No major information gaps.
    score1: |
      Section is very sparse or missing most key elements; important information is absentor only hinted at. Hard to understand the candidate from this section alone.
  ContentQuality:
    score5: |
      Follows clear Action → Method → Impact with quantifiable results; very specific; includestools, methods, or techniques; shows strong, measurable improvement.Examples: social media with +35% engagement; Random Forest churn model (72%→88%, churn -20%);stakeholder management reducing escalations by 60%.
    score3: |
      Partially follows Action → Method → Impact; has some specifics but lacks clear, quantifiedresults; reasonable but not strong.Examples: using Meta Business Suite to plan/publish content; churn model mentioned but no metrics;weekly stakeholder meetings to keep schedule.
    score1: |
      Very generic; only action with no method or impact; no tools, no metrics, low clarity.Examples: "Managed social media", "Built a prediction model", "Worked with stakeholders".
  Grammar:
    score5: |
      Grammar, spelling, and sentence structure are correct and natural; bullets are easy to read;verb tenses are consistent; only very minor or rare typos, if any.
    score3: |
      Some grammar or spelling issues, but the text remains understandable; occasional awkward phrasingor tense inconsistency, yet overall readability is acceptable.
    score1: |
      Frequent grammar and spelling mistakes; sentences are confusing or broken; tense usage isinconsistent; the reader must work hard to interpret the meaning.
  Length:
    score5: |
      Length is appropriate for the section: not too short, not overly long; information is denseand relevant; each sentence or bullet adds value without obvious redundancy.
    score3: |
      Length is somewhat suboptimal: either a bit short (missing some detail) or somewhat long withmild repetition or low-value bullets, but still usable.
    score1: |
      Length is clearly inappropriate: either extremely short (1-2 vague lines) or very long andrepetitive with many low-information bullets or sentences.
  RoleRelevance:
    score5: |
      Content is strongly aligned with the target role: tasks, tools, domain, and responsibilitiesclearly match what is expected for the <targetrole> role; shows appropriate seniority and impact.
    score3: |
      Content has partial alignment with the target role: some relevant skills or responsibilities,but mixed with less relevant tasks or not yet at the depth/seniority typically expected for<targetrole>.
    score1: |
      Content is mostly unrelated to the target role: focuses on other domains or generic duties;very little evidence that directly supports readiness for <targetrole>.

feedback:
  globalfeedback: |
    After scoring all criteria, analyze all criterion-level feedback together.
    Then generate a concise overall evaluation for this section ("session_feedback") that:
    - Synthesizes strengths and weaknesses across all criteria
    - Explains what the section does well and what limits its effectiveness
    - Avoids repeating individual criterion feedback verbatim
    - Reflects how this section impacts the candidate's positioning for the target role
    - Limit the session_feedback to one short paragraph with <session_feedback-word> words.
